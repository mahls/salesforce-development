# üñ•Ô∏è Salesforce Back-End Development Overview

This document outlines the core back-end technologies and tools in Salesforce development, including server-side logic, data management, and APIs.

---

## üîß What Is the Back-End in Salesforce?

The back-end of Salesforce development revolves around **Apex**, **triggers**, and **integrations** such as APIs and automation tools. These handle the server-side logic and data processing in the Salesforce platform.

## üß† Core Back-End Technologies

### 1. üßë‚Äçüíª Apex

- **What it is:** A strongly typed, object-oriented programming language similar to Java.
- **Use Case:** Writing business logic, data manipulation, custom web services.
- **Why use it:** Built specifically for Salesforce with access to platform events, DML, and SOQL.
- **Example:**
  ```apex
  public class AccountHandler {
      public static void updateAccounts(List<Account> accounts) {
          for (Account a : accounts) {
              a.Description = 'Updated via Apex';
          }
          update accounts;
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. üîÑ Triggers

- **What it is:** Apex code that executes before or after record changes in the database (insert, update, delete, etc.).
- **Use Case:** Automating processes like validation, logging, and rollups.
- **Best Practice:** Use **handler classes** to keep logic modular.
- **Example:**
  ```apex
  trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
      for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
          acc.Description = 'Created via trigger';
      }
  }
  ```

---

### 3. üì° SOQL / SOSL

- **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language):** Used to query records (like SQL).
- **SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language):** Used for full-text searches across objects.
- **Example:**
  ```apex
  List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Name FROM Contact WHERE Email != null];
  ```

---

### 4. üåê Salesforce APIs

- **REST API:** CRUD operations via standard HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
- **SOAP API:** For systems that require XML and WSDLs.
- **Bulk API:** For large-scale data loads.
- **Metadata API:** For deploying and retrieving metadata.

Use tools like **Postman** or **Salesforce Workbench** to test API calls.

---

### 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Flow, Process Builder, and Apex Automation

- **Flow (Declarative):** Visual tool for building logic without code.
- **Process Builder (Legacy):** Being replaced by Flow.
- **Apex Scheduled Jobs:** Custom CRON-like tasks written in Apex.
- **Queueable / Batch Apex:** For long-running or async processing.

---

## üß© Other Backend Features

- **Platform Events:** Real-time pub/sub model for apps.
- **Custom Web Services:** Create REST endpoints with `@RestResource`.
- **Security Layers:** CRUD/FLS, Sharing, and Authentication must be respected in Apex code.

| Technology               | Type                       | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Apex                     | Programming language       | Core logic, triggers, classes            |
| Triggers                 | Event-driven logic         | Auto-processing on DB changes            |
| SOQL/SOSL                | Query languages            | Data search and filtering                |
| REST/SOAP/Bulk APIs      | Integration layer          | External app integration                 |
| Flow                     | Declarative automation     | Logic without code                       |
| Queueable/Batch Apex     | Async processing           | Large or deferred logic                  |
| Platform Events          | Messaging                  | Real-time integrations                   |

## üß† Recommendation

If you're focusing on back-end Salesforce development:

- **Master Apex** (including async patterns like Batch and Queueable)
- **Understand SOQL/SOSL thoroughly**
- **Know how to design Triggers properly**
- **Use Platform Events and REST APIs for integrations**
- **Leverage Flow where possible for maintainability**
