History of Salesforce Development
=================================

üß© Overview
-----------
Salesforce was founded in 1999 by Marc Benioff as a customer relationship management (CRM) platform delivered through a then-novel model: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Over the years, Salesforce evolved from a simple CRM system into a robust platform-as-a-service (PaaS) known as the Salesforce Platform.

-----------------

2000s ‚Äì Early CRM Focus
------------------------
- Salesforce started as a cloud-based CRM.

2006 ‚Äì Apex & Visualforce
--------------------------
- Apex: Salesforce introduced its proprietary programming language for business logic and backend development.
- Visualforce: A tag-based markup language for creating custom UI screens within Salesforce.
- These tools marked the beginning of custom-code development in Salesforce.

2012 ‚Äì Salesforce1 Platform
----------------------------
- Rebranding of the development stack as the ‚ÄúSalesforce1 Platform‚Äù.
- Focused on mobile-first development.
- Emphasis on integration with social, mobile, and cloud features.

2014 ‚Äì Lightning Experience & Components
----------------------------------------
- Launch of Lightning Experience, a modern UI framework.
- Lightning Components (Aura): Introduced reusable UI components written in a new JavaScript-based framework.
- Lightning App Builder enabled low-code development through drag-and-drop components.

2019 ‚Äì Lightning Web Components (LWC)
-------------------------------------
- LWCs introduced a standards-based way to build components using modern JavaScript.
- More performance-oriented and aligned with web standards (ES6+).
- Allowed interop with Aura Components and improved developer productivity.

2020s ‚Äì DevOps & Modern Tooling
-------------------------------
- Salesforce CLI (sf) launched with modern DX tooling.
- Scratch orgs, source tracking, and SFDX project format adopted.
- Integration with Git, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools like VSCode.
- Emphasis on API-first, event-driven architecture, and scalable integrations.

2023+ ‚Äì AI, Automation, and DevOps Center
-----------------------------------------
- Einstein AI and GPT-based automation introduced to enhance CRM intelligence.
- Flow Builder expanded to replace much of Apex use cases in automation.
- DevOps Center officially released to help manage change sets and deployments in a more developer-friendly way.

üîß Modern Development Stack
---------------------------
- Apex (backend logic)
- Lightning Web Components (frontend)
- SOQL/SOSL (query languages)
- Flows (low-code automation)
- REST/SOAP APIs (integration)
- Salesforce CLI (local development & deployment)
- Scratch orgs, Unlocked Packages, and Metadata API

üéØ Key Takeaway
---------------
Salesforce development has grown from basic customization to a full-fledged application development platform. It now supports pro-code, low-code, and no-code paradigms, catering to a wide range of developers, admins, and business users.
