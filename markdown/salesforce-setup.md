# 🚀 How to Set Up Salesforce for Free

You **cannot** install Salesforce on your own servers like open-source software because Salesforce is a **proprietary cloud-based CRM** owned by Salesforce.com. However, you **can access Salesforce for free** through official channels.

Salesforce offers a **free Developer Edition** account:

- A fully functional Salesforce environment.
- Ideal for:
  - Learning
  - Building apps
  - Writing Apex code
  - Testing Lightning Components
