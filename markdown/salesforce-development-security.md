# Salesforce Development Security

## Introduction
Salesforce development security is crucial to protect sensitive business data, ensure compliance, and maintain trust. Developers must follow best practices to secure applications built on the Salesforce platform.

## Key Security Concepts

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- Use Salesforceâ€™s built-in authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, SAML, etc.).
- Implement proper user permissions and profile settings.
- Use permission sets and permission set groups to assign access.

### 2. Apex Security
- Use with sharing keyword to enforce record-level access.
- Avoid using `without sharing` unless necessary and understood.
- Use `stripInaccessible` methods to prevent unauthorized field access.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SOQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

### 3. SOQL and SOSL Security
- Use bind variables instead of string concatenation in SOQL queries.
- Avoid dynamic SOQL when possible; if used, carefully validate inputs.

### 4. CRUD and FLS Enforcement
- Enforce Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) permissions in Apex.
- Enforce Field-Level Security (FLS) before accessing or modifying fields.

### 5. Data Encryption
- Use Shield Platform Encryption for sensitive data.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit when applicable.

### 6. Secure Lightning Components
- Follow Lightning Locker Service guidelines.
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in client-side code.
- Use `@AuraEnabled` and `@wire` carefully to control access.

### 7. Secure API Usage
- Use named credentials for external integrations.
- Use OAuth scopes to limit API access.
- Monitor API usage and enforce rate limits.

### 8. Logging and Monitoring
- Use debug logs wisely and limit exposure.
- Use Salesforce Event Monitoring for security auditing.
- Regularly review login history and audit trails.

### 9. Third-Party Packages
- Review security reviews for AppExchange packages.
- Limit package permissions to minimum required.

## Best Practices Summary
- Always follow the principle of least privilege.
- Regularly review and audit security settings.
- Keep up-to-date with Salesforce security advisories.
- Educate users and developers on security awareness.
